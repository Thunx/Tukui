Elv:
	- LDB datatexts shouldn't display information that is 'n/a'
	- CombatFade with pet should now be working as intended and no longer is always faded no matter what your player setting is set to.
	- Fix "memory block too big" lua error when deleting a skada frame and Skada is embed right.
	- Fix lua error when moving the ExtraButton frame on first UI load.
